# 🏧 Day 5 - ATM Menu Simulator

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 5** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today’s project simulates a basic ATM menu system right in your terminal — no PIN required! 💳

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **Control Flow in Python** — making decisions, looping through options, and organizing logic cleanly by using  `if`, `while`, and `match-case`.

---

## 💭 Why Build This?
ATM systems are a great example of **interactive menus** and **decision-making** in programming. This project teaches you how to guide users through different choices and respond to their actions with logic.

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the ATM simulator can do:
- 💰 Check current account balance
- ➕ Deposit money
- ➖ Withdraw money with balance validation
- ❌ Exit the system gracefully
- 🔁 Loop the menu until the user decides to quit

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🧠 `if-else` statements
- 🔄 `while` loops for continuous interaction
- 🎯 `match-case` for clean menu handling (Python 3.10+)
- 🔐 Input validation and error handling

---

## 🚀 Getting It Running

### ✅ What You’ll Need
Just Python 3.10 or higher (for `match-case`).  
Run it using:
```bash
python Day05Code.py
